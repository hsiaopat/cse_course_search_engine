## Overview
Our goal with this project is to combine the advantages of the GPS system with those of the PATH class search in an interactive web application. We want users to be able to view graduation requirements while also being able to see specific courses that are available to them based on the classes theyâ€™ve already taken, streamlining the process of organizing a short-term and long-term course schedule.
